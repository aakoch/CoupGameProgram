I made this for fun based on the Coup card game: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup
Please do NOT try to monetize this code without permission from me and the creators of Coup.

Main Code Requirements:
Java 7
Javafx jar

Test Code Requirements:
JUnit
Mockito

Running the remote UI program:
Run on the machine you want to use as server:
java game.remote.CoupServer [numberOfPlayers] 
Run on a different machine for each player (note, one player can be on the server machine):
game.remote.CoupClient [ipOfServerMachine] [portNum]*
*portNum should start at 4445 and increment by 1 for each additional player.  You must launch the players in port order starting with 4445 and going up.

NOTE:  You can create an executable jar to distribute this game to other players without giving them the source code .java files.

Have fun!  And remember to still support the creator of Coup by buying a real copy of the game!
